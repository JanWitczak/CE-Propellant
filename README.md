# Combat Extended Propellant

This is a mod for game Rimworld, dependant on the [Combat Extended](https://github.com/CombatExtended-Continued/CombatExtended) mod.


## Description
This mod makes Combat Extended industrial tech ammunition more time consuming to manufacture, and require propellant to craft.

Propellant is crafted from cloth in biofuel refinery (20 to 10), or at 50% yield at a crafting spot. Propellant refining is locked behind gunpowder tech.

Mod Settings allow adjusting steel, propellant, and other costs, as well as work needed and market value.
Traders stock of Ammunition, Medium Ammunition and Heavy Ammunition can be scaled as well.

Additionally this mod adds volatiles category, contaning chemfuel, propellant, FSX and Prometheum.
